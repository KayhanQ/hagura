I started designing Origami a while back and completed my book 'Origami Animal Shapes' last year. Designing Origami models that are 'new' or novel is not trivial, for a few reasons.

Firstly there's the prime directive: "Origami must be made out of a square of paper, you can only fold and no cuts are allowed." It's pretty amazing that with that kind of a limitation people make things like Robert Lang's Bull Moose, and yes, it has no cuts and is made from a single square of paper.

The second reason is that there's a lot of Origami that has already been designed. Origami began hundreds of years ago and has exploded in the last 70 years. There's literally thousands of models.

So given these factors how do you make something new? I did two things. The obvious one was that I design models that hadn't really been made before, like my Roast Chicken which is below. There's only one other roast chicken model that I am aware of by Joseph Wu.

</div>

The style of my Origami would be described as simple. The models consist of basic polygonal shapes. There's a lot of Origami like this, however, while my models look simple they aren't easy to fold. I use some more advanced folding techniques in the models. This isn't a very common thing to do. Origami techniques usually grow in complexity with the visual complexity of a model. This mis-match of technique to style results in something different.

<div>	
	{%include image.html name="origami-canada-goose.png" caption="Origami Canada Goose"%}
</div>

A good example of this is the Canada Goose model. While it looks pretty simple it's quite challenging to fold. That's not something you'd usually expect with Origami.

Currently the book is complete with 10 original models. All the diagrams were made in Adobe Illustrator and the final design was done in Adobe InDesign. If you're interested in seeing a copy just get in touch!
